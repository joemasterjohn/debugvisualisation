## News replaced ##

The news section replaced to an external page. To be honest, a wiki page is not the best solution for news. For further news, refer to http://blog.cubussapiens.hu/. This page is gone deprecated.

## Plans changed! ##

I changed the plans for future development. Version 0.5.2 will not be released, and the project will be rewritten over the JFace API. In the meantime the project base package will be change from hu.gbalage.debugvisualisation to hu.cubussapiens.debugvisualisation.

Check out the new [Roadmap](Roadmap.md) page for further information.

## Version 0.5.1 released! ##

A new version is released with some issues fixed. Some issues are delayed until 0.5.2 mostly because lack of time.
Fixed issues in this release:
  * [Mysterius NullPointer exception bug](http://code.google.com/p/debugvisualisation/issues/detail?id=2&can=1)
  * [It is possible now to hide nodes in the graph](http://code.google.com/p/debugvisualisation/issues/detail?id=3&can=1)
  * [Node states (hidden/shown, open/closed) are saved between context switches](http://code.google.com/p/debugvisualisation/issues/detail?id=5&can=1)

A new update site is started, and the plugin is released on it. Read the [wiki](http://code.google.com/p/debugvisualisation/wiki/Installing) for further information.
